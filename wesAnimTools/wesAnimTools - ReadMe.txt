Hey there!

Here is my set of tools.  Just copy the contents of the 'wesAnimTools' folder  into your 'scripts' folder. 


Your maya prefs folder should be located somewhere in your Documents.  For example:

C:\Users\WesleyC\Documents\maya\scripts\wesTools (folder)
C:\Users\WesleyC\Documents\maya\scripts\wesAnimTools.py
C:\Users\WesleyC\Documents\maya\scripts\userSetup.py



Tip: If you don't want it to auto-load, just remove the userSetup.py file.  You can then launch it with a python command:


import wesAnimTools
wesAnimTools.UI()


Any issues, feel free to contact me: heywesley@gmail.com
